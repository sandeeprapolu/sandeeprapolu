# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Sandeep Rapolu

ðŸ’» **QA Automation Engineer | Eager Learner | Future Open Source Contributor**

I'm passionate about building scalable, maintainable automation frameworks and constantly exploring better ways to test software. With 4+ years of experience in test automation for web, mobile, and API platforms, I'm now looking to **learn, grow, and contribute** to the open-source community.
